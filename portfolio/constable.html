  <p>Link for Constable was the first major project assigned by the teachers at the Awesome Inc Bootcamp. The objective of the project was to create a website introducing
  the public to your fictional candidate for Constable. The website should explain why your candidate was running for Constable. The teachers also requested that we include
   a sass file that gets converted to a css file.</p>
<p>For this all day project, I decided to pick Link from the Legend of Zelda gaming series to run for constable since in his games he fights the forces of evil.
 As for the technical requirements, I looked at previous class examples to figure out how to convert sass into css. To convert sass into css, I created a package.json file and wrote a script
that would watch my sass file and covert it into a css file. I also included some other scripts that helped me see my styling updates as soon as I saved my project. This made it easier to
to view my changes. With the sass file I chose to change the bootstrap colors to green and gold theme to better reflect the Legend of Zelda color scheme. I also decided to incorporate
 a third party font to continue with the theme of Legend of Zelda.</p>
 <h3 class='text-center'>Conclusion</h3>
 <p>I enjoyed being able to create something silly in effort to test what you have learned. I also enjoyed that I had time to incorporate thing we didn't learn in class, such as adding third party font in
 the project. This really helped me to not be afraid of trying something new in a time restricted project. </p>
