  <p>Tea Cozy was a project assigned by Codecademy to test my skills with the css concept of the box model. I had to make sure that all of the item on
  site are properly positioned. Codecademy provided the wireframe and what the site had to look like for grading purposes. I was able to replicate the site for
the most part but the instructor pointed out that the would scroll to the right uncecessarily due to an item being outside of a div which caused part of the item to be
outside of the body of the site. I made sure that after the project to fix that issue.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p> From this project on, I made it a habit to always go back to your previous project to try to fix anything that is broken your try to improve on anything that is lacking.</p>
