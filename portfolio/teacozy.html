  <p>Tea Cozy was a project assigned by Codecademy to test my skills with the css concept of the box model. I had to make sure that all of the items on
  site were properly positioned. Codecademy provided the wireframe and the images for the project. I was able to replicate the site for
the most part but the instructor pointed out that the site would scroll to the right uncecessarily due to an item being outside of a div. This caused part of the item to be
outside of the body of the site. I made sure that after the project to fix that issue.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p> From this project on, I made it a habit to always go back to my previous projects to try to fix anything that is broken or try to improve my code to make it more efficient.</p>
