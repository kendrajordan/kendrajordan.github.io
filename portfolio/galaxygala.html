      Galaxy Gala was the fourth major project done in Awesome Inc's coding bootcamp. The requirements for this project was to create a community-edited virtual art gallery by the end of the day. The exhibits in the gallery were to be images found on the internet. All registered users can add exhibits to the
      gallery's collection, edit exhibits that have already been added, or remove exhibits. Each exhibit should include the following information:
      <ul>
        <li>id</li>
        <li>name of the exhibit</li>
        <li>year the exhibit was created</li>
        <li>artist's name</li>
        <li>URL to image</li>
        <li>description of the the exhibit</li>
        <li>timestamps</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>I chose the gallery theme of 'Images of Space' because I have always found those types of images fascinating and that NASA usually has the best images to
    choose from. Before I started coding, I made sure that my database was created in Postgresql and that it was incorporated into my Laravel project. I also made sure that everything
  was setup and ready to be deployed by the end of the day to Github and Heroku. After that I worked on my table migrations and made sure to include all the fields required for the
project. With the exhibit table setup, I established a relationship between users and exhibits. The relationship was that a user can own many exhibits and
that an exhibit belongs to a user.With the relationship established I was able to start seeding my project with exhibits to see if everything I setup was working properly.</p>
<p> The steps taken in creating an exhibit and storing it on my site through a controller was similar to another project I
   created called <a href="/portfolio/Bumblr">Bumblr</a>, so I used that as reference throughout this project. When comparing the two projects, I felt like I had more of an understanding
 of how to work in Laravel and I didn't experience as many issues as I did with Bumblr due to me having more experience with the technology.</p>
<h3 class='text-center'>Conclusion</h3>
<p> I really enjoyed working on this project. Being able to see a project through from start to finish in one day really shows how much I have grown as a developer.
