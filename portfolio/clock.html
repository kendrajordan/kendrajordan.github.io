  <p>The Vue clock was a project done in class at Awesome Inc's coding bootcamp. Initally, the clock was worked on in class together. Then the teacher
  requested that we create an alarm and a countdown clock on our own.</p>
  <p>Working on the setting the alarm was relatively easy. I first added hours, minutes and seconds as data items in vue.js and v-modeled them to selectors to set a time.
  Then I converted that converted the inputted set time into milliseconds. Afterwards, I converted the current time into milliseconds and subtracted the difference between the set time and the
current time. The difference between the set time and the current time is set to a variable called timerremainder. I then had to write an if statement saying if the set time is greater than the current time in milliseconds then set a time out function that will go off when the timeremainder in milliseconds has
lapsed else have the app say that the time has passed.</p>
<p>As for the countdown clock, that took more time to figure out. I was unsure where to start with the countdown timer so I researched online to see if there were any answers in how to create a countdown clock. I found a
solution in W3 schools on how to create a countdown clock but it was in vanilla javascript. I was able to convert most of the vanilla javascript into vue.js syntax but I was having trouble calling my countdown function
in the setinterval method. I kept getting an error saying my countdown function wasn't a function. I looking all over stackoverflow and I found a similiar issue. It turns out that I needed to use a callback function to
make my code work.</p>
<h3 class='text-center'>Conclusion</h3>
<p>This project was great in practicing code logic. This project was also good for reviewing time methods. I will comeback to this project if I need to create a countdown clock or an alarm.</p>
