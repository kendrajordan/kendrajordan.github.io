  <p>Giphy Search was a project that incorporated handling Ajax requests in a Vue.js application along with the use of localstorage. The class at Awesome Inc's coding bootcamp was
    told to use the giphy.com's documentation to figure out how to manipulate Ajax requests to show different results.The two pieces of data you could manipulate through giphy.com
     was the query data and the limit data. So I created a function that would replace the query and limit data in the url with an input that was v-modeled to
     query and limit data items in the data object in vue.js.
  </p>
  <p>To have the ajax request stay on the web browser, I implemented the use of localstorage on the current query and limit data. This is so if I clicked on any of the giphy images and
  clicked the back button, my search results will still be there.</p>
  <h3 class='text-center'>Conclusion</h3>
  <p> This project has been very useful in helping me understand how to handle ajax requests in vue.js. I how to use it as a reference for future projects.</p>
