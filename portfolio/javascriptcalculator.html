  <p>The Javascript calculator was asignment given by one of the teachers at Awesome Inc. The teacher assigned us to groups of two to work on a calculator that is capable of
  basic calcualtor functions such as adding, subtracting multiplying and dividing. The groups were only allowed to use vanilla Javascript to create the calculator. During the project I found out that my
strength was using bootstrap while my partner's strength was using Javascript.</p>
  <h3 class='text-center'>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>It was great working with other students to complete a project. It helped me look at new ways to solve a problem and it helps me figure out which subjects I am week at so that I can improve on them in the future.</p>
