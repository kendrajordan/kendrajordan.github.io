  <p>The Javascript calculator was an assignment given by one of the teachers at Awesome Inc's coding bootcamp. The teacher assigned us to groups of two to work on a calculator that would capable of
  basic calcualtor functions such as adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing. The groups were only allowed to use vanilla Javascript to create the calculator. During the project I found out that my
strength was using bootstrap to design the calculator, while my partner's strength was using Javascript. We both exchanged ideas on how to build the calculator and gained new insight into the skills that we were lacking.</p>
  <h3 class='text-center'>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>It was great working with other students in completing a project. It helped me look at new ways in solve a problem and it also helped me figure out which subjects I am weak at so that I can improve on them in the future.</p>
