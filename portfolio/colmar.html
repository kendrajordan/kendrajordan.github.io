  <p>This was a project I did for Codecademy that tested my ability to use css and html to create a university website. Codecademy provide the images and the
    wireframe for the project and they wanted me to be able to replicate the wireframe for the site. Other than for following the wireframe, I had creative liberty
    with the colors and the typography. I truly enjoyed challenging myself in replicating the site.</p>
  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>This was the project where I decided it was a good time to change careers and join a coding bootcamp to become a junior developer.</p>
