<p> The Vue Word count was a project assigned to the class of Awesome Inc's coding Bootcamp where we were asked to create an app that is able to count how many
characters, words, sentences and paragraphs are in a passage. The teacher also wanted our app to tell you what the longest word in the passage was. This project was an exercise
on how to use regular expressions in vue.js. To accomplish this task, I had to research how to use regular expressions. I came across this <a href="https://www.regexpal.com/">tool</a>
that helped me in constructing the right regular expressions for the project.</p>
<h3 class='text-center'>Conclusion</h3>
<p>I have a greater appreciation for regular expressions after this project and hope to use the new tool that I found to help me on future projects.</p>
