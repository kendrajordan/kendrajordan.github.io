<p> The Vue Word count was a project assigned to the class of Awesome Inc's coding Bootcamp. We were asked to create an app that was able to count how many
characters, words, sentences and paragraphs in a given passage. The teacher also wanted our app to tell you what the longest word in the passage was. This project was an exercise
on how to use regular expressions in vue.js. To accomplish this task, I had to research how to use regular expressions. I came across this <a href="https://www.regexpal.com/" target="_blank">tool</a>
from a site called regexpal.com that helped me in constructing the right regular expressions for the project. It also provided a cheatsheet that went over the usage of each regular expression character.</p>
<h3 class='text-center'>Conclusion</h3>
<p>I now have a greater appreciation for regular expressions after working on this project and hope to use the new tool I found to help me on future projects.</p>
